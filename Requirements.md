## Process of generation Using LLM

### Initial Prompt

I want to train my development skills in a project with these characterístics:

- A Web application;
- Focusing in transactional operations;
- Using SGBD or a NOSQL database;
- No data science involved;
- No Image processing;
- No Sound processing;
- Rich UI with some complex components.

I choose to use an Auction Plataform because it has:

1- Higher Transactional Complexity: The auction platform inherently involves more complex transactional operations, especially real-time bidding, concurrent bid handling, and auction closing logic. This provides a deeper dive into transactional system design and concurrency management compared to the booking system. You'll likely encounter more challenging scenarios in ensuring data consistency and handling race conditions in the auction environment.
2- Richer and More Dynamic UI Challenges: While both have rich UI potential, the Auction Platform pushes the boundaries further in terms of dynamic, real-time UI. Implementing features like live bid updates, countdown timers, outbid notifications, and dynamic bid histories will require you to explore more advanced front-end technologies and techniques for real-time data updates (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or similar). The Booking System's UI is rich, but might be slightly more predictable and less focused on real-time interactivity.
3- Database Design for High Concurrency and Transactions: Designing the database for an auction platform needs to consider high transaction volume, especially during popular auctions. You'll need to think about database performance, indexing, and potentially techniques for handling concurrent writes and reads efficiently. While the Booking System also requires a well-designed database, the auction's needs might push you to explore more advanced database optimization strategies.
4- Hi Learning Potential in Real-time Technologies: Developing the Auction Platform provides a stronger incentive and necessity to learn and implement real-time communication technologies in your web application stack, which is a valuable skill in modern web development.

I need you to pretend to be my client for this project, you already have a list of requirements:

- As a bidder, I want to easily browse items for auction with clear images and descriptions, including current bid prices and remaining time.
- As a bidder, I want to be notified immediately (via web notification and/or email) when I am outbid on an item.
- As a seller, I want to be able to list items for auction with detailed descriptions, multiple high-quality images, set starting prices, and choose auction durations.
- As a bidder, I want to be able to place bids quickly and easily from the item listing page, with clear confirmation of bid placement and current highest bid.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for items by keywords, categories, price range, and auction status (open, closed, upcoming) using filters and sorting options.
- As a bidder, I want to maintain a "watchlist" of items I am interested in so I can easily track their bidding status without having to search for them again.
- As a seller, I want to be able to view the current bidding activity on my listed items, including the number of bids and current highest bid.
- As a bidder, I want to see a clear bid history for each item, showing bid amounts and timestamps, so I can understand the bidding competition.
- As a registered user, I want to be able to manage my profile information, including my bidding history, watchlist, and seller listings in a personal dashboard.
- As a seller, I want to be able to set up automatic re-listing of items if they do not sell in the initial auction.
- As a user, I want to receive email notifications about auctions I am participating in, including auction end reminders and notifications if I win or lose.
- As an administrator, I want to be able to manage user accounts, categories, and monitor auction activity for fraud or policy violations.
- As a bidder, I want to be able to bid automatically using a proxy/automatic bidding system, setting a maximum bid so the system bids incrementally for me up to my limit.
- As a seller, I want to be able to choose different auction types (e.g., standard auction, buy-it-now option) for my listings.
- As a user, I want to be able to provide feedback and ratings for sellers and view seller ratings to make informed bidding decisions.

Now I want you to think about it:

1- This list is good enough? Can you improve it?
2- Can you add more functional requirements?
3- Show me the final improved list.

## Best Response from Gemini Thinking

Yes, the list is a very good starting point! It covers many essential functionalities of an auction platform. However, we can definitely improve it and add more details to ensure a more comprehensive and user-friendly platform.

Here’s an analysis and suggested improvements:

**1. Is the list good enough? Can you improve it?**

The list is good as a *foundation*, but it's not exhaustive.  We can definitely improve it by:

*   **Adding more specific details:** Some points are a bit generic. For example, "manage profile information" can be broken down into specific actions.
*   **Considering edge cases and less obvious functionalities:**  Think about the entire user journey and potential problems or needs that might arise.
*   **Ensuring all critical user roles are fully addressed:** While Bidder, Seller, and Administrator are covered, we need to ensure the functionalities for each role are complete.
*   **Thinking about non-functional requirements implied by the functional ones:**  For instance, "real-time notifications" implies a need for specific technologies and performance considerations.

**2. Can you add more functional requirements?**

Yes, absolutely. Here are some additional functional requirements categorized by user roles and general platform functionalities:

**For Bidders:**

*   **Payment Options:** As a bidder, I want to be able to pay for won items using various secure payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, other online payment gateways).

     """

    Now you must prioritize this list so that:
        1- You show only the numbers of each requisite;
        2- For each requisite, show me the rational that explains why it should be in that position of the prioritized list.

## Response from Gemini Thinking

    Okay, as your client for this Auction Platform, let's prioritize these requisites. I'm thinking about what's absolutely essential first, what makes the platform usable and valuable, and then what are the nice-to-haves that enhance the experience later.

    Here's my prioritized list, with rationales:

    1.  14 - As a new user, I want to be able to easily register an account using email/password or social login, and manage my account details securely.

        Rationale: Account registration is the absolute foundation. No one can use the platform as a bidder or seller without an account. It's the very first step for any user interaction and must be smooth and secure.

    2.  1 -  As a bidder, I want to easily browse items for auction with clear images and descriptions, including current bid prices and remaining time.

        Rationale: Browsing items is the core activity for bidders. If I can't see what's for sale easily and understand the key information (images, description, price, time left), the platform is useless as an auction site for buyers. It's the visual storefront of the platform.

    3.  8 - As a seller, I want to be able to list items for auction with detailed descriptions, multiple high-quality images, set starting prices, and choose auction durations.

        Rationale: Listing items is the core activity for sellers. Without sellers being able to easily put items up for auction, there's nothing for bidders to bid on! This functionality drives the entire marketplace.

    4.  3 - As a bidder, I want to be able to place bids quickly and easily from the item listing page, with clear confirmation of bid placement and current highest bid.

        Rationale: Bidding is the fundamental action on an auction platform. If placing bids is difficult, slow, or unclear, bidders will be frustrated and less likely to participate. Easy bidding is crucial for engagement and the platform's purpose.

    5.  6 - As a bidder, I want to be able to pay for won items using various secure payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, other online payment gateways).
    
        Rationale: Payment is essential to complete the auction process. If bidders win but can't pay easily and securely, the whole system breaks down. Multiple secure options cater to a wider user base.

    6.  15 - As a user, I want to have secure password management options, including password recovery and the ability to change my password easily.

        Rationale: Security and user account management are paramount for trust and usability. Users need to be able to manage their passwords securely, including recovery if forgotten, to maintain access and protect their accounts.

    7.  4 - As a bidder, I want to be able to search for items by keywords, categories, price range, and auction status (open, closed, upcoming) using filters and sorting options.

        Rationale: Once there are many items, search and filtering become crucial for bidders to find what they are interested in. It enhances discoverability and user experience significantly, moving beyond just basic browsing.

    8.  9 - As a seller, I want to be able to view the current bidding activity on my listed items, including the number of bids and current highest bid.

        Rationale: Sellers need to monitor their listings to understand interest and manage their auctions effectively. Visibility into bidding activity gives them essential feedback and control.

    9.  2 - As a bidder, I want to be notified immediately (via web notification and/or email) when I am outbid on an item.

        Rationale: Outbid notifications are vital for bidder engagement and competitiveness. It keeps bidders informed and encourages them to re-bid, driving up auction activity and value.

    10. 5 - As a bidder, I want to maintain a "watchlist" of items I am interested in so I can easily track their bidding status without having to search for them again.

        Rationale: A watchlist enhances user convenience and engagement, particularly for bidders tracking multiple items. It simplifies tracking and encourages return visits to the platform.

    11. 17 - As an administrator, I want to be able to manage the categories and subcategories available on the platform, adding, editing, and deleting them as needed.

        Rationale: Category management is crucial for platform organization and discoverability. Administrators need control over categories to ensure the platform is well-structured and items are properly classified for users to find them effectively.

    12. 11 - As a seller, I want to be able to save item listings as drafts before publishing them, so I can work on them over time.

        Rationale: Draft listings are a valuable convenience for sellers, especially for complex listings. It allows them to prepare listings at their own pace and ensures accuracy before going live, improving seller experience.

    13. 12 - As a seller, I want to be able to easily categorize my items within the platform's defined categories and potentially suggest new categories if needed.

        Rationale: Easy categorization for sellers is essential for item discoverability and platform organization. Suggesting new categories allows the platform to evolve and adapt to user needs and new item types, although less critical than initial category management.

    14. 10 - As a seller, I want to be able to set up automatic re-listing of items if they do not sell in the initial auction.

        Rationale: Automatic re-listing is a seller convenience feature that can increase the chances of items selling and reduce seller effort. While beneficial, it's not as core as initial listing or bidding functionalities.

    15. 7 - As a bidder, I want to be able to save my search queries and receive notifications when new items matching my saved searches are listed.

        Rationale: Saved searches and notifications are advanced features for power users, enhancing personalization and discovery for niche interests. They improve user retention for specific types of buyers but are not essential for the basic platform functionality.

    16. 16 - As a user, if the platform targets multiple regions, I want to be able to choose my preferred language and currency.

        Rationale: Language and currency selection is important for internationalization and targeting multiple regions. However, for an initial platform launch, especially if focused on a single region, this is a lower priority and can be added later for expansion.

    17. 13 - As a user, I want to be able to search for items by keywords, categories, price range, and auction status (open, closed, upcoming) using filters and sorting options.

        Rationale: This is a duplicate of requirement #4 but stated from a "user" perspective rather than specifically "bidder". Since bidder is a user, requirement #4 already covers this. It's good to reiterate user accessibility to search but in terms of prioritization, the bidder requirement #4 already ensures this functionality is high priority. Therefore, in terms of new priority, it's redundant.

    This is my take as your client.  Let me know what you think!
